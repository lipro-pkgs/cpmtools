This branch contains cryptographic signatures for the source tar files of
[www.moria.de/~michael/cpmtools](http://www.moria.de/~michael/cpmtools/) or
[github.com/lipro-cpm4l/cpmtools](https://github.com/lipro-cpm4l/cpmtools).

The Debian watch file could get them from here to verify the source tar files.
