    The pristine upstream source may contains obfuscated files, that are
    thereby not appropriate for use as source files. This violates DFSG §2.
    .
    The 'uscan::repack' functionality will removes those files with the help
    of the list on entry 'Files-Excluded:' in this file to create the Debian
    upstream source tarball.
    .
    The orig.tar.xz is just repacked Debian upstream source tarball (currently
    without changes). See section get-orig-source in 'debian/rules' file and
    'debian/watch' file for details.
